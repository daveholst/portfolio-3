        I'm a country kid with a passion for technology and the outdoors. I like
        to spend my time camping, hiking, kite-surfing, fishing, diving and
        doing multi-day motorbike expeditions out in the desert. I've always
        been a tinkerer, pulling things apart to see how they work and if they
        will go back together again!
    </p>
    <p>
        I would consider myself a generalist, not afraid of the unknown and keen
        to jump into any codebase. I love to learn, and nothing pleases me more
        than learning a new technology, pattern or way of working. I like
        listening to podcasts and watching twitter to try and see what 'the next
        big thing will be'. In my personal projects I spend a lot of time
        playing with and testing new frameworks and tools.
    </p>

        My personal technology interests include making, programming,
        electronics, home-automation and home-labbing. I'm always on the quest
        to see what I can create to make life easier, this has lead me to
        automate my entire house using a mix of open-source, self designed and
        commercial products. All these devices become compatible with each other
        through back-end systems running on a server in my shed. I hit the
        ceiling of what I could achieve with no programming knowledge and I
        started learning from courses online. I had found my passion and how I
        wanted to spend the rest of my working life. This prompted me to enroll
        in a bootcamp at UWA and continue my self-learning in parallel and I
        haven't stopped learning since.

        I have previously worked as a Teacher with degrees in both Design and
        Education and have a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering. I am well versed
        at creating and making in a range of contexts. I see software
        engineering as applying what I have been doing for years, solving
        problems, just with a different tool set.

    <p class="svelte-ny62v7">I&#39;m a country kid with a passion for technology and the outdoors. I like
        to spend my time camping, hiking, kite-surfing, fishing, diving and
        doing multi-day motorbike expeditions out in the desert. I&#39;ve always
        been a tinkerer, pulling things apart to see how they work and if they
        will go back together again!
    </p>
    <p class="svelte-ny62v7">I would consider myself a generalist, not afraid of the unknown and keen
        to jump into any codebase. I love to learn, and nothing pleases me more
        than learning a new technology, pattern or way of working. I like
        listening to podcasts and watching twitter to try and see what &#39;the next
        big thing will be&#39;. In my personal projects I spend a lot of time
        playing with and testing new frameworks and tools.
    </p>
    <p class="svelte-ny62v7">My personal technology interests include making, programming,
        electronics, home-automation and home-labbing. I&#39;m always on the quest
        to see what I can create to make life easier, this has lead me to
        automate my entire house using a mix of open-source, self designed and
        commercial products. All these devices become compatible with each other
        through back-end systems running on a server in my shed. I hit the
        limits of what I could do with my lacking programming knowledge. As a
        result, through my studies at UWA and self-learning, I am happy to now
        call myself a Full Stack Developer.
    </p>
    <p class="svelte-ny62v7">I have previously worked as a Teacher with degrees in both Design and
        Education and have a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering. I am well versed
        at creating and making in a range of contexts. I see software
        engineering as applying what I have been doing for years, solving
        problems, just with a different tool set.
